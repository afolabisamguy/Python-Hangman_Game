# Python Hangman CLI Game

Welcome to the Hangman CLI Game! This is a command-line version of the classic word-guessing game where you try to guess a word one letter at a time. With each incorrect guess, a part of the ASCII art of a hangman is drawn. Once the hangman is fully drawn, the game is over, and you lose. You'll be prompted to play again if the game ends.

## Features

- **ASCII Art Hangman**: Visual representation of the hangman displayed with each wrong guess.
- **Word List**: A text file containing the words to guess.
- **Replayability**: After each game (win or lose), you'll be asked if you'd like to play again.

## How to Play

1. Run the main script from your command line.
2. The game will pick a random word from the word list.
3. Guess letters one at a time.
4. For each wrong guess, a part of the hangman will be drawn.
5. You win by guessing all the letters of the word before the hangman is fully drawn.
6. If you lose, youâ€™ll be asked if you want to play again.
